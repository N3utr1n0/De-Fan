# Discord bot - a basic framework
It works, sort of. 

I will NOT provide personal support for any issues. Feel free to modify the code how you see fit but please dont deploy it publically. Keep it in your server.. As it stands right now it works perfectly fine but it is tailored to my personal server

There are admin commands and some other misc commands that can be extended. 

This is really just a basic framework.
